# ðŸ’£ PR Landmines for Azure DevOps
A simple, language agnostic solution for creating manual mutation tests directly in-line with an Azure DevOps pull request

# Overview
Using GitHub? See [github-pr-landmine](https://github.com/tylermurry/github-pr-landmine)

As a reviewer, it's important you feel comfortable with the code quality in a PR.
Mutation testing is a powerful way to gain confidence in the tests, but it can be difficult, time-consuming or even inappropriate to seek high-levels mutation coverage in some cases.

PR Landmines allow reviewers to strategically add mutations to the code of a PR and verify the tests will catch the issue. All while using the existing Azure DevOps pull request interface to keep things in-line and straight-forward. 

#### Why would I use this?
* Takes seconds to implement and is language agnostic
* Great for applications that have little-to-no mutation coverage
* Perfect for applications that get their coverage from slower-running integration tests rather than unit tests
* A powerful conversation starter to educate others on the benefits of testing in real-time

#### When would I not use this?
* The solution isn't recommended for applications that have lots of unit tests and good mutation coverage.

# Install the Task for Your Organization
1. Install the [PR Landmine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tylermurry.pr-landmine) extension in your organization. [More information here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/marketplace/install-extension?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser)
1. Add the task into your pull request build:

    ```yml
    steps:
    - task: pr-landmine@1
      inputs:
        testCommand: 'npm test'
    ```
    If you are using the `System.AccessToken` (default), be sure to set `persistCredentials` to `true` if it's not already:
    ```yml
    steps:
    - checkout: self
      persistCredentials: true
    ```  
1. Grant the build job user the `Contribute to pull requests` permission to allow it to add pull request comments. [More information here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions?view=azure-devops#set-git-repository-permissions)
1. Now you're Ready to lay down some mines! ðŸ’£

# Add a Landmine to a Pull Request
1. In a pull request, choose a file and select the range of code where you would like to create a landmine.
1. Start the comment with either the bomb emoji ðŸ’£ or `/bomb`. Either of these will signal to the task that the comment is a landmine.
1. On the next line, use the [code suggestion syntax](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/introducing-the-new-pull-request-experience-for-azure-repos/#add-suggested-changes-and-commit-within-a-pull-request) to inject mutated code.
1. Re-run the pull request job and the landmine comment should be annotated with the success or failure of the bomb defusal.

# Task Options
| Property               | Required | Default Value                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -----------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `accessToken`          | Yes      | `$(System.AccessToken)`             | The access token used to retrieve and update comments on the pull requests                                                                                                                                    |
| `testCommand`          | Yes      |                                     | The command that is executed after each landmine is added. Ideally, this includes other static validation such as linting.                                                                                    |
| `testCommandDirectory` | No       | `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)` | The directory to apply the test command. Useful if your tests are orchestrated in a different directory than root.                                                                                            |
| `testCommandTimeout`   | No       | `60000`                             | The number of milliseconds to wait before bailing on the test command. Needs to be sufficiently high to run the test suite but low enough to catch infinite loops or runaway threads created by the mutation. |
| `autoResolve`          | No       | `true`                              | If the bomb is defused successfully, the original pull request comment will be auto-resolved.                                                                                                                 |
